# Cell-profile-a-tool-to-classify-cell-in-expressing-different-fluorescence-labeled-molecules.
This is a tool to identify the cell nucleus with a Weka-trained model. These identified nucleus is classified by fluorescence positive or negative cell according to auto-threshold or user defined threshold.

## Goal
Classify cells with different expression of fluorescence labeled molecules

## Modality
Widefield fluorescence microscopy

## Image
Nuclear channel and additional channels for different fluorescence labels

## Sample
Tissue section of mice
