# Cell classification from dual fluorescence labels  [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/749085983.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10608752)

Fluorescence-based cell classification is a high-throughput strategy for identifying cells expressing different molecules.
Here I offered two scripts based on Fiji to classify cells automatically or user interactively. 
Both of the labeled molecules are expressed in the nucleus. Therefore, the nuclear staining is prerequisite of this tool. 
The input image was composed by three fluorescence channels. DAPI staining represents the nuclear positions. The other two channels are acquired from two fluorescence labeled molecules in the nuclei.
Two trained models from Weka are available in this repository to generate the region-of-interesting (ROI) list for further analysis.
The mask images from molecule staining channels are generated by autothreshold Otsu and MaxEntropy methods or by user definalbe interface.
Then the ROI are applied on the mask images to classify cells with different exprssion patterns.

## Instruction
1. Install Fiji.
2. Download the model according to the contrast of the nuclear channel.
3. Save the model in the same folder of raw images.
4. Download the ijm script of autothreshold version or the user definalbe version.
5. Drag and drop a raw image and execute the script.
